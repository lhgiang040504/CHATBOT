Following are some of the algorithms of Machine Learning used in self-driving cars: 1.) Regression algorithms:This algorithm helps in object detection, object localization and predicting movements of the nearby vehicles. It uses the repetitive aspects of an environment to form a statistical model of the relation between a particular image and the position of a specific object within the image. 2.) Cluster algorithms: Cluster algorithms excel at discovering structure from data points.it may also occur that classification algorithms (pattern recognition algorithms) have missed identifying an object, thereby failing to classify and report it to the system. This may happen due to the images being of very low-resolution or with very few data points. In such situations, it becomes difficult for the system to detect and locate objects in the surroundings. Clustering algorithms define the class of problem and class of methods. Generally, clustering techniques are established using centroid-\\xadbased and hierarchical modeling approaches. 3.) Decision Matrix Algorithms: Decision matrix algorithms are essentially used for decision making. These algorithms determine the moves of the self-driving car. So, whether the car needs to take a left or a right turn, whether it needs to brake or accelerate, the answer to such questions is determined by the accuracy of these algorithms concerning classification, recognition, and prediction of the objects’ next movement.'],\n",

The fuzzifier  m determines the level of cluster fuzziness. A large m results in smaller membership values, Wij , and hence, fuzzier clusters. In the limit  m=1, the memberships, Wij , converge to 0 or 1, which implies a crisp partitioning. In the absence of experimentation or domain knowledge,  m is commonly set to 2.

Hence, we will now make a circle with BS as the center just as big as to enclose only three datapoints on the plane. The three closest points to BS are all RC. Hence, with a good confidence level, we can say that the BS should belong to the class RC. Here, the choice became very obvious as all three votes from the closest neighbor went to RC.
